# Fusion Kitchen
Imagine that you're designing a system to manage different types of restaurants. You notice that all restaurants share some basic features - they all have a name, an address, and they all serve some kind of food. However, each type of restaurant also has its unique characteristics. A Mexican restaurant might have a spice level rating, while a Japanese restaurant might have a traditional seating style.

In this project, we'll use inheritance in C++ to model these relationships. We'll start with a base `Restaurant` class that contains the common features all restaurants share. Then, we'll create specialized restaurant classes for different cuisines using a single inheritance. Finally, we'll explore the exciting world of fusion cuisine by creating a Mexican-Japanese fusion restaurant using multiple inheritance!

Think of it like a family tree:

- The `Restaurant` class is the parent, containing all the basic features.
- Specific restaurant types (Mexican, Japanese) are children, inheriting these basic features while adding their own unique traits.
- The fusion restaurant is like a child of both Mexican and Japanese restaurants, combining features from both cuisines!

Through this project, you'll practice how to:

- create a base class with common functionality
- use single inheritance to create specialized restaurant types
- implement multiple inheritance to create a fusion restaurant
- manage restaurant-specific features and menus

The source code for this project will be organized into the following files:

- `Restaurant` base class: **Restaurant.hpp** and **Restaurant.cpp**
- `MenuItem` class: **MenuItem.hpp** and **MenuItem.cpp**
- `MexicanRestaurant` class: **MexicanRestaurant.hpp** and **MexicanRestaurant.cpp**
- `JapaneseRestaurant` class: **JapaneseRestaurant.hpp** and **JapaneseRestaurant.cpp**
- `MexicanJapaneseRestaurant` class: **MexicanJapaneseRestaurant.hpp** and **MexicanJapaneseRestaurant.cpp**
