# The Secure Banking System
In this project, you’ll build a basic banking system in C++ that uses **encapsulation** to manage account data. You’ll create a `BankAccount` class to store account details and manage how the data is accessed and changed, ensuring proper behaviour and efficient handling of account operations. Users interact with the account only through carefully designed methods, just as you interact with your bank account through an ATM or online banking platform.

**- `BankAccount` class:** This class will store data like account numbers and balances as private members. It will also include transaction methods such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

**- `Transaction` class:** This class will handle individual transactions, like deposits and withdrawals, within the `BankAccount`.

**- `Bank` class:** This class will act as the overall manager of multiple `BankAccount` objects. It will be responsible for managing account creation, tracking balances, and securely handling transfers between accounts.

By the end of this project, you will have built an encapsulated banking system in which each class and method plays a defined role. We aim to keep the data well-organized and only accessible through proper channels, ensuring efficiency and security while adhering to good design principles.
